											<h2>Strategery</h2>
										</header>
										<p class="biggerTxt">The goal of this project was to create a simple analog game with rules that could fit on a single page, using only materials
											that could either be printed alongside the rules, or reasonably found in a normal home (simple stationary, coins, pieces from other common
											board games, etc). We then had to not only provide feedback to each other, but also observe multiple playtests across a 4 week period, using
											the feedback and experiences to revise the game for clarity and enjoyment. This was particularly challenging, as we were in the middle of the
											Covid-19 pandemic at the time, limiting the ways that playtests could be performed and playtesters acquired.</p>
										<p class="biggerTxt">In designing my game for this project, I wanted to create some interesting strategic choices without incredibly complex systems.
											One way I achieved this was by having the players limit both their opponent’s and their own moves based on their previous actions: once one player
											takes an action, it cannot be performed again until that player takes a different action, forcing players to think both ahead and on their feet.
											I also tried to design the scoring system to encourage strategic diversification: it isn’t easy or often possible to focus solely on one color of
											points, and generally wouldn’t be the best strategy if you could, but spreading your choices out too much could also give your opponent too many
											bonuses for having more of a given color.</p>
										<p class="biggerTxt">As a side-note, the title "Strategery" comes from an inside joke with my parents. There are a number of nonsense words that
											have come up over the years as a result of someone getting tongue-tied or the like, which then become running gags that are brought up periodically.
											This one happened to feel fitting as a working title for the goals I had in mind while designing the game, and it ultimately stuck.</p>
